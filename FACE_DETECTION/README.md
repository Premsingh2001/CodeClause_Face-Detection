# FACE_DETECTION
I have successfully completed task 1 of Artificial Intelligence internship with CodeClause! In this task, you utilized the powerful capabilities of OpenCV for face detection. OpenCV is a highly optimized Computer Vision library that provides a wide range of tools for image and video processing, including real-time processing capabilities.



One of the key features of OpenCV is its ability to support model execution for Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence. This allows developers to build advanced AI applications that can perform complex tasks such as object detection, image segmentation, and natural language processing.



Overall, OpenCV is a powerful tool for AI development that provides a wide range of features and capabilities. By leveraging this library, developers can build advanced AI applications that are both efficient and highly accurate.
